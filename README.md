# multigrid
Multigrid method for the Poisson problem with extensibility in mind


## Build
Has the following dependencies:
  * *OpenMP:* for cpu parallelization of solvers
  * *Eigen*: for direct solving of sparse linear systems (no particular version required)
  * [google benchmark:](github.com/google/benchmark) for measuring solvers performance
  * *python 3 + numpy + matplotlib + pandas*: for plotting experimental results
  * [sympy](https://www.sympy.org): for producing symbolically the exact solution for convergence tests

Compile the examples and tests as a standard cmake project:
```(bash)
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

The `SYCL` branch has a SYCL compiler dependency, further compilation instructions are in `CMakeLists.txt`.


## Overview
The project implements a geometric multigrid solver for 1D and 2D square grids. It uses C++ runtime polimorphism to capture the variability of PDE problems. It essentially boils down to specializing three virtual classes:
  * **Problem**: has knowledge about the discretization used and the system rhs, returns an
  * **Operator**: knows how to relax the solution and can produce a sparse matrix representation of itself
  * **Solver**: given a problem, applies multigrid solver (or an iterative one) to a privately owned solution and is problem & operator agnostic


## Features
  * Extensible design: can solve stencil based discretizations for 1D and 2D problems, given a suitable class implementation
  * Python plotting of experimental results like residual convergence and solve time
  * Convergence tests with problem parameters symbolically generated by sympy
  * Benchmarking of multigrid solver performance with automatic parsing and plotting of results
  * Rich multigrid parameters selection (smoother, cycle, grid transfers...)
